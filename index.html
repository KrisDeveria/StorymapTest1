            <p>Agriculture in the Netherlands is unique. <br><br> As the video above shows, it is well known that this tiny country is the 2nd largest food exporter of agricultural products in the world, after only the USA. The Netherlands began developing in this direction already in the 19th century, though this development really took off after WW2, when they vowed never to go hungry again. This led to a powerful focus on agricultural efficiency, emphasizing increasing production through technological innovations such as mechanization, usage of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides. It also included changes in management practices such as land consolidation, and economic changes such as fixed minimum prices for agricultural products like milk.</p>

            The impact of these changes were so impressive that, during the 1980s, farmers produced more milk than they could sell, despite some two thirds of all produced dairy being sold abroad, to countries such as Germany and France. After hefty campaigns to get people to consume more dairy products and get demand to meet supply, the EEG (EU-predecessor) mandated that production had to decrease. This led to the introduction of a ‘milk quota’, meaning that farmers would be taxed if they produced too much milk. Farmers then started to sell their cows, or change their feed so that the cows would produce less milk. Farmers were not happy about this as it led to a drop in their income.
            <br><br>Then in 1987, the ‘Meststoffenwet’ - the manure law - was introduced, limiting the amount of manure farms were allowed to produce. This led to additional pressure on farmers to keep track of manure production, and to further reduce the amount of cows they were allowed to keep.
            <br><br>In 1992, the MacSharry-reform led to reductions in agricultural product prices - dairy farmers were financially compensated per cow. But farmers were unhappy as their total revenue was reduced, leading to farmer protests in The Hague.
            <br><br>5 years later the introduction of the ‘Varkenswet’ (pig law) meant that farmers had to reduce the amount of pigs kept in order to further reduce manure production. Millions of pigs need to be eradicated, in large part also due to outbreaks of ‘swine fever’, also known as ‘pig plague’. - animal diseases have led to the need to eradicate millions of agricultural animals.
            <br><br>2015: milk quota repealed, seen as a kind of ‘liberation day’ by farmers, who (advised by /lured by? The Rabobank) decide to expand their business, investing in increasing their cattle and expanding their barns.
